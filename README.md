# Algorithms
Major algorithms and problems implemented in C++ and C

SOURCES and CREDITS

I have included a few problems from Karan's megalist of projects, other sources will be updated as I work through them.

SOLUTIONS

The solutions are available and comments are included wherever necessary, please feel free to add new projects or remove existing ones.

QUESTIONS

1. Program to which gives the next number in the **Fibonacci sequence** when called, starts off with 1(ignore 0).Ex: 112358..

2. **Rock the Dates**: Write functions to find the next day/previous day given a date, find a date after n days, check if a date is valid,etc. To add some challenge assume that the inputs are pointers to date structures. Please feel free to add any other functions you want!

3. **Zip function**: You have 2 arrays of equal length, you need to merge the corresponding elements of the array into one array and return an array of arrays at the end. Conside the example
of array [a,b,c] and [d,e,f] the function should return [[a,d],[b,e],[c,f]].

4. **Array of Strings in C**: C program that contains a varied list of functions, that use dynamic memory to handle an array of strings in C. Sorting function added.

5. **Array representation of a binary tree**: C program that represents a binary tree using an array. Partial implementation of serealization and deserealization.

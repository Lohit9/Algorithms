# Algorithms
Major/Interesting algorithms and problems implemented in C++ and C

SOURCES and CREDITS

I have included a few problems from Karan's megalist of projects, other sources will be updated as I work through them.

SOLUTIONS

The solutions are available and comments are included wherever necessary, please feel free to add new projects or remove existing ones.

QUESTIONS

1. Program to which gives the next number in the **Fibonacci sequence** when called, starts off with 1(ignore 0).Ex: 112358..

2. **Rock the Dates**: Write functions to find the next day/previous day given a date, find a date after n days, check if a date is valid,etc. To add some challenge assume that the inputs are pointers to date structures. Please feel free to add any other functions you want!

3. **Zip function**: You have 2 arrays of equal length, you need to merge the corresponding elements of the array into one array and return an array of arrays at the end. Conside the example
of array [a,b,c] and [d,e,f] the function should return [[a,d],[b,e],[c,f]].

4. **Array of Strings in C**: C program that contains a varied list of functions, that use dynamic memory to handle an array of strings in C. Sorting function added.

5. **Array representation of a binary tree**: C program that represents a binary tree using an array. Partial implementation of serealization and deserealization.

6. **Kth minimum element**: C Program to find the kth minimum element in array, quite common in interviews(I was asked this in the Zynga interview).

7. **Binary tree to List**: C program to convert a binary tree to a list. 

8. **Binary Arithmetic Using Binary trees**: C program that uses binary trees to perform BODMAS calcualations 

9. **Amortized analysis and Dynamic Array**: C program that implements and explains amortized(average) analysis and simple intro to dynamc arrays

10. **Linked List**: The interface file contains various function implemented using and for linked list. Great excericise to get familiar with them. 

11. **Binary Search Tree**: Implementation and various fuctions for operations such as traversal, sorting, searching, etc in bst's.

12. **Max-Min Stack**: Implementation of stack that stores the maximum and minimum elements (can be retrieved in O(1) time), functions include pop, push, max , min, length, etc.

13. **Count/Sequence ADT**: Implementation for storing the count (number of occurrences of an integer within a sequence and other operations related to it. Implemented using an dynamica array and using a binary search tree.

14. **Queue ADT**: Implementation of Queue and various operations list add-front, remove-back, etc. 

15. **Dictionary ADT**: Implementation of Dictionary adt and various operations like lookup, insert, traversal etc.

Upcoming: Given a Binary Search Tree with integers at every node and   an integer k, write code that decides whether or not there exists two nodes a and b such that a+b=k

The above question was asked in Zenefits interview
